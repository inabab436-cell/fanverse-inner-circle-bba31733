- The active product is a client-side 3D (React Three Fiber, ssr:false) social space on the index route; keep legacy community data untouched while retiring its UI, to avoid destructive data loss.
- Touch input in the 3D scene uses pure slot assignment in src/lib/touchControls.ts (phone-only, PUBG split: a finger landing on the left half walks with a floating stick, one on the right half orbits the camera; each slot released independently) so the two fingers never cancel each other.
- Use pure movement functions (src/lib/movement.ts, px units) for locomotion, and per-frame state in refs read by one useFrame; this keeps input and animation independent of React renders.
- Avatar selection includes a user-uploaded GLB with its original appearance; normalize all models through useAvatar, but recolour atlas cells and attach the uniform print only for the legacy Kenney models, to preserve uploaded artwork and the existing movement system. Uploaded models without clips translate and turn without skeletal animation.
